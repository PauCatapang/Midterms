        <h2>Story</h2>
        <p>A friend to all is a friend to none<br>
            Chase two girls, lose the one<br>
            When you are young, they assume you know nothin<br>
            <br><br>
            But I knew you<br>
            Playing hide-and-seek and<br>
            Giving me your weekends,<br>
            I knew you<br>
            Your heartbeat on the High Line<br>
            Once in 20 lifetimes<br>
            <br><br>
            And when I felt like I was an old cardigan<br>
            Under someone's bed<br>
            You put me on and said I was your favorite<br>
            <br><br>
            To kiss in cars and downtown bars<br>
            Was all we needed<br>
            You drew stars around my scars<br>
            But now I'm bleedin'<br>
            <br><br>
            'Cause I knew you<br>
            Steppin' on the last train<br>
            Marked me like a bloodstain,<br>
            I knew you<br>
            Tried to change the ending<br>
            Peter losing Wendy,<br>
            I knew you<br>
            Leavin' like a father<br>
            Running like water,<br>
            And when you are young, they assume you know nothing<br>
            <br><br>
            But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss<br>
            I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs<br>
            The smell of smoke would hang around this long<br>
            'Cause I knew everything when I was young<br>
            I knew I'd curse you for the longest time<br>
            <br><br>
            Chasin' shadows in the grocery line<br>
            I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired<br>
            And you'd be standin' in my front porch light<br>
            And I knew you'd come back to me<br>
            You'd come back to me<br>
            And you'd come back to me<br>
            And you'd come back<br>
            <br><br>
            And when I felt like I was an old cardigan<br>
            Under someone's bed<br>
            You put me on and said I was your favorite<br>
            <br><br>
